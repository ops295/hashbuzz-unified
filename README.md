## 📘 The story of hashbuzz

In 2014, the Ice Bucket Challenge swept across social media. More than 17 million people posted videos. The campaign raised 115 million dollars for the ALS Association in a few weeks. That wave of attention proved two things. People will mobilize for a cause. Attention can move real value. [1](https://www.als.org/blog/als-ice-bucket-challenge-year-end-update-over-94-million-commitments-2014?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

What was missing was a fair way to reward the millions who created that value with their time, creativity, and trust. There was no open ledger of who contributed what. No simple way for communities and campaigners to align incentives, prove authenticity, and share value directly. The moment was powerful. The rails were not built for shared value. The result was a one-time spike instead of an ongoing, verifiable system. (For context on the totals and global scale [2](https://www.als.org/ibc?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Hashbuzz exists to make moments like that repeatable and fair. Promoters run on open rules. Engagement is recorded. Rewards flow to the people who earn them. Communities keep more of the value they create.

**Hashbuzz transforms the attention economy into a fair, participatory system that values cultural diversity and local context. By rewarding authentic voices with BUZZ tokens, we amplify influencers, strengthen communities, & help brands build genuine trust.**

##  🔀 Hedera Integration Summary 
A dedicated, concise paragraph for each Hedera service used, explaining the
why (e.g., "We chose HCS for immutable logging of critical supply chain events because its
predictable $0.0001 fee guarantees operational cost stability, which is essential for lowmargin logistics in Africa.").   
This should be further detailed with: 

**Transaction Types:** 
List the specific Hedera transactions executed (e.g., TokenCreateTransaction, ContractExecuteTransaction, TopicMessageSubmitTransaction). 

**Economic Justification:**
Explain how Hedera s low, predictable fees, high throughput, or ABFT finality directly support the project s financial sustainability and user adoption in Africa.
